## Viral Content Principles

### The 3-Second Rule
- First frame must stop the scroll
- Use text hooks: "POV:", "Wait for it", "Nobody talks about this"
- Visual shock or curiosity in frame 1

### Relatability is King
Best performing daily moments:
- Morning routines (coffee, alarm, getting ready)
- Work life (meetings, commute, pretending to work)
- Tech frustrations (WiFi dying, phone battery, losing headphones)
- Adulting fails (laundry, cooking, cleaning)
- Late night moments (3am scrolling, overthinking)

### Emotional Triggers That Go Viral
1. **Nostalgia** - "Remember when..."
2. **Frustration** - Shared annoyances
3. **Aspiration** - "One day I'll..."
4. **Shock** - Unexpected twists
5. **Validation** - "I thought I was the only one"

0:08-0:12  PEAK      - Maximum visual/emotional impact
0:12-0:15  PAYOFF    - Satisfying conclusion or cliffhanger
